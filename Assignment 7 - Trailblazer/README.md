# Assignment 7- Trailblazer 

Details for [Trailblazer][1]!

This assignment basically covers the implementation of five different graph alogorithms:

1. Depth First Search
2. Breadth First Search
3. Dijkstra Algorithm
4. A* Algorithm
5. Kruskal's Algorithm

Each of them has pretty interesting properties.

Also,  you basically know A* once you know Dijkstra.

No example runs for this assignment, but check-out the [Trailblazer][1] assignment page if you're interested.

Or you can download the file and run it yourself! :-)
