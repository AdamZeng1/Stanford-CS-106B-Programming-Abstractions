# Stanford-CS-106B
Tackling the Stanford's CS 106B class Online

Heyo All!

This is the new _github repository_ where I will be posting the _solutions_ that I come up with _for the Stanford CS 106B course_.

I am still very much learning! 

If you noticed something wrong with my code/bad-style/redundancy etc. please highlight it to me and I will be very glad to learn from it and have the code corrected to become better!

Also, check out the [wiki][1] if you're interested in taking this course in your own time but cannot commit much time

Topics Covered:
* Abstraction and its relation to programming
* Software engineering principles of data abstraction and modularity
* Object-oriented programming
* fundamental data structures (such as stacks, queues, sets) and data-directed design. 
* Recursion and recursive data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs). 
* Introduction to time and space complexity analysis.

Kaizen,
Winston

ATTENTION: STANFORD STUDENTS

I believe that if you are a current CS 106B student at Stanford University who has not yet made a final submission of this assignment, then looking at this solution will constitute a violation of Stanford's Honor Code.

You have been warned!

Till next time, have fun!
