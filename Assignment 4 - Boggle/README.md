# Assignment 4 - Boggle

Details for Boggle can be found [here][1]!

This assignment implements the Boggle game and has two main components:

* A human turn where the human enters a word and the game check if the word is valid (longer than 4 letters) and can be found on the board.
* A computer turn where the computer will recursively search for all the words that the human missed out on the board.

The files that were modified by us were [Boggle](./src/Boggle.cpp) and [boogleplay](./src/boggleplay.cpp).

The program also runs with two seperate components, a graphical user interface (GUI), and a text base interface.

User interacts with the text based interface and changes are reflected on the GUI.
