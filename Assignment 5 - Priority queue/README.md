# Assignment 5 - PriorityQueue

Details for [PriorityQueue][1]!

The main aim of this assignment is to implement a priority queue class.

The priority queue class is implemented in three ways:
* Using an unsorted array as its interal data structure
* Using a sorted link list as its internal data structure
* Using an heap array as its internal data structure

There isn't links to example run for this assingment.

Still Curious?

Maybe check out the [official assignment handout][1]!
